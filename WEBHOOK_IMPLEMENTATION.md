# GoHighLevel Webhook Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented the GoHighLevel webhook integration in your Daikin Airco Limburg web application. Here's what was done:

### 1. **Dual Submission System**
- Created `/src/utils/email.ts` that sends form data to both:
  - EmailJS (primary email service)
  - GoHighLevel webhook (backup/CRM integration)
- Only fails if BOTH services fail, ensuring redundancy

### 2. **Environment Variables**
- Created `.env` file with all sensitive credentials
- Created `.env.example` for documentation
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` from version control

### 3. **Updated Contact Forms**
Both contact forms now use the new dual submission system:
- `/src/components/sections/contact-form.tsx`
- `/src/components/sections/contact-optimized.tsx`

### 4. **Thank You Page**
- Created `/src/pages/tot-snel.tsx` - a professional thank you page
- Forms automatically redirect there after successful submission

### 5. **Webhook Test Page**
- Created `/src/pages/contact-webhook-test.tsx` for testing webhook-only submissions
- Access at: `/contact-webhook-test`
- Has noindex meta tag to prevent search engine indexing

### 6. **Analytics Integration**
- Created `/src/utils/analytics.ts` for tracking form submissions
- Ready for Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel integration
- Currently logs to console for debugging

## Key Features

1. **User Experience**
   - Toast notifications for success/error feedback
   - Loading states during submission
   - Automatic form reset on success
   - Redirect to thank you page

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation if one service fails
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Debug mode available in email.ts

3. **Security**
   - All sensitive data in environment variables
   - Webhook URL can be changed without code modification
   - Form validation using Zod

## Testing

1. **Test the webhook**: Visit `/contact-webhook-test`
2. **Test production forms**: Try both contact forms on the site
3. **Enable debug mode**: Set `DEBUG_MODE = true` in `/src/utils/email.ts`

## Next Steps

1. **Google Analytics**: Add GA tracking script to index.html
2. **Facebook Pixel**: Add Pixel tracking script to index.html
3. **Monitor webhook**: Check GoHighLevel for incoming leads
4. **Deploy**: Push to production and test live environment

## Environment Variables Required

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
VITE_GHL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/...
```

The implementation is complete and ready for production use!
